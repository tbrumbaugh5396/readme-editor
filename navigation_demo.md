## Overview

The README Editor now supports intelligent link navigation:

1. **Internal Links** - Navigate within the document to specific sections
2. **External Links** - Open in browser as before
3. **Auto-generated Anchors** - All headers get navigation anchors
4. **Tree Synchronization** - Clicking internal links updates the tree selection

## Navigation Features

### Click Behavior

When you click a link in the preview panel:

- **Internal links** (starting with `#`) navigate to that section in the preview
- **External links** (`http://`, `https://`, `mailto:`) open in your browser
- **Section highlighting** - navigated sections are briefly highlighted
- **Tree updates** - the structured editor tree automatically selects the target section

### Auto-generated Table of Contents

The structured editor automatically generates a table of contents with working navigation links. Try clicking the links in the table of contents above!

## Testing Internal Links

Here are some internal navigation links to test:

- Go to [Overview](#overview) - should scroll to the Overview section
- Jump to [Advanced Features](#advanced-features) - should scroll down
- Return to [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) - should scroll to the top

Each section also includes a "← Table of Contents" link for easy navigation back.

## External Links

These links should open in your browser:

- [GitHub](https://github.com) - External website
- [Python.org](https://python.org) - Another external site
- [Email Example](mailto:test@example.com) - Email link

## Advanced Features

### Section Management

- **Toggle sections** on/off while preserving content
- **Visual indicators** for disabled sections in the tree
- **Bulk operations** with Enable All / Disable All buttons
- **Right-click context** menu for section controls

### Live Updates

- **Dynamic table of contents** that reflects enabled sections only
- **Status bar feedback** when navigating or toggling sections

### Integration

- **Format menu support** for quick markdown insertion
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for common formatting operations
- **Cross-editor compatibility** - navigation works in both general and structured modes

## Conclusion

The enhanced navigation system makes it easy to:

1. **Navigate large documents** with internal links
2. **Test README structure** with live preview
3. **Manage complex projects** with section toggling
4. **Create professional documentation** with auto-generated TOCs
